# 2Dgame

The repository contains a solution for visual studio. It uses SDL dlls for graphics - all required 
files to make it work (libraries, header files, dlls) are there. The properties for visual studio project
are set to find relative paths to them. They are set only in x86 Debug mode (libraries are 32bit). The program should run
after compilation in that mode.
